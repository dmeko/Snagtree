Matlab functions, scripts and standalones for dendroclimatology and hydrology. User must have access to matlab to run some analyses, but without matlab can run standalones. 

The files here allow the following types of analysis (*=standalone (exe) also)

-skelcrn: skeleton plotting
-seascorr: correlation analysis to identify seasonal climate affecting tree growth
